PixelGrid.java: Contains code to remove a bluest value column or random column from an image.
Action.java: Contains code to add an action, which will allow users to later undo column removals.

This is a project I worked on for my Computer Science course second semester of my first year. The project will calculate the blue value sum of every column in an image, and then allow a user to delete the bluest column out of an image. There is also an option to remove a random column and to undo any removals. Blue columns will be highlighted in blue before they are removed. Random columns will be highlighted in red before they are deleted.

All image versions will be saved as new files.
